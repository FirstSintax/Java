If Else Plant

#####Problem Statement#####
Charlie has to plant some plants and doesn't know which pot to put it in. Luckily his business is being shutdown and you have been asked to take over. Charlie has 3 different pots, for 3 different sizes of plants. You want to keep all the plants happy, so you must account for their maximum height, which is it's current height plus its potential growth. Given a plant's current height, and it's potential growth height, determine the type of pot to put it in, given that you want to minimize pot sizes.

- Small pots may store plants that grow up to 8 inches.
- Medium pots may store plants that grow up to 15 inches.
- Ultimate pots may store plants of any size.

#####Input Format#####
- An integer $N$, denoting a plant's current height
- An integer $M$, denoting the potential growth of a plant

#####Constraints######
- $0 \leq N \leq 10,000$
- $0 \leq M \leq 10,000$

#####Output Format#####
A single word, "Small", "Medium", or "Ultimate" that  is the smallest pot you can use for the plant whilst still accounting for its growth potential.
