#####Problem Statement#####
Charlie sucks at math and needs you to check his homework. Today he is working on trying to reduce fractions and you need to help determine if he has reduced a fraction fully. Given N, the number of problems Charlie needs checked, output the number of problems he has to correct. If he did not make any mistakes tell him "Goodjob!"

#####Input Format#####
- A single integer N  denoting the number of problems to check
- N lines containing two integers, p and q denoting the fraction p/q
Note: p/1 counts as fully reduced.

#####Constraints#####
- 0 < N < 100
- 0 < p,q < 15,000,000

#####Output Format#####
If Charlie reduced all the fractions fully print out "Goodjob!" otherwise print out a single integer denoting the number of problems Charlie got wrong.
