Longest Contiguous Increasing Subsequence

#####Problem Statement#####
Charlie was going to the bathroom when unfortunately he forgot his phone. Now he is forced to read the back of his fertilizer bottle. Charlie sees a list of numbers and wants you to find the longest continuous subsequence that is strictly increasing. Note: A sequence can be of length 1.

#####Input Format#####
- An integer $N$, the number of terms in the sequence
- $N$ integers, $a_0,a_1,...,a_{n - 1}$, that form the sequence of numbers

#####Constraints#####
- $1 \leq N \leq 1,000,000$
- $-1000 \leq a_i \leq 5,000,000$

#####Output Format#####
- A single integer, signifying the longest strictly increasing continugous subsequence
